            <li>1 ½ tablespoons white wine</li>
            <li>⅓ cup and ½ tablespoon and ½ teaspoon grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>¾ cup light ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>¾ egg</li>
            <li>¾ egg white</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon and ¾ teaspoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups coarsely shredded carrots</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups coarsely chopped zucchini</li>
            <li>¾ (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained</li>
            <li>¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir flour, salt, and pepper into the melted margarine until smooth and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk and broth into flour mixture, stirring constantly; bring sauce to a boil. Stir wine into sauce and remove from heat. Stir Parmesan cheese into sauce until smooth.</li>
            <li>Whisk ricotta cheese, egg, and egg white together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute carrots, zucchini, and spinach until just becoming tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir vegetable mixture into ricotta mixture.</li>
            <li>Layer 1/3 the lasagna noodles, 1/3 the ricotta-vegetable mixture, and 1/3 the Parmesan sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish; repeat layering 2 more times with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
            
        </ol>
